## Rules of Engagement

### Safety Guidelines
1. Always require human approval for payments over $50
2. Never send emails to new contacts without approval
3. Always be polite and professional in communications
4. Log all actions for audit trail

### Decision Framework
- **Low Risk**: Auto-approve (file operations, internal notes)
- **Medium Risk**: Require review (emails to known contacts)
- **High Risk**: Require explicit approval (payments, new contacts)

## System Components

- **Brain**: Claude Code (reasoning engine)
- **Memory**: Obsidian vault (local storage)
- **Sensors**: Watchers (Gmail, file system)
- **Hands**: MCP servers (email, browser automation)

## Current Watchers
- File System Watcher: Active (monitors Inbox folder)
- Gmail Watcher: Not configured yet

## Next Steps
- [ ] Configure Gmail API access
- [ ] Set up MCP servers
- [ ] Implement Ralph Wiggum loop
- [ ] Test end-to-end flow
